# USA Housing Price Prediction

This project is a simple linear regression model that predicts housing prices in the USA based on several variables such as Area Population, Number of Rooms, House Age, and Income. 
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanths028/usa-housing/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/mrufaid/USA-Housing-Linear-regression
   cd USA-Housing-Linear-regression
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:(Not required in google colab)

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Python file:
   ```bash
   python linear_regresson_pr1_p1
   ```
### Usage

1. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanths028/usa-housing/) and save it as `USA_Housing.csv` in the root directory of this project.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the linear regression model and make predictions.

3. The project includes data visualization, correlation analysis, data preprocessing, and model training steps.

4. The trained model will predict housing prices based on the provided input variables.
